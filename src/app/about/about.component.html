<h2>ONLINE SHOPPING FOR WOMEN</h2>
<p>Online Shopping Site for Fashion & Lifestyle in India.<br> India's Fashion Expert brings you a variety of footwear, Clothing, Accessories and lifestyle products </p>
<p>Women are happy to meander through sprawling clothing and accessory collections or detour through the shoe department. They like to glide up glass escalators past a grand piano, or spray a perfume sample on themselves on their way to, maybe, making a purchase. For men, shopping is a mission. They are out to buy a targeted item and flee the store as quickly as possible, according to new Wharton research.</p>
<h2>What Women Shop Online For</h2>
<p> The aspect of WHAT is being purchased by males and females is surprisingly often regarded as the case solved and closed long ago – men purchase gadgets and technology, while women are obsessed with fashion items. On the one hand, this assumption can’t be called an entirely false one. On the other – this is a rough generalization that merchants accept and put into the base of their brand positioning as well as marketing and advertising campaigns. At the time when sex and gender stereotypes are largely cast off and rethought, it is inappropriate and harmful to a store or a brand to follow them blindly. Instead, base your marketing concepts on proven statistical data</p>

<p>When carrying out your <b>eCommerce strategy</b>, you need to know who your product’s target is. Buying decisions change according to the gender of consumers. For example, what women may find amazing, men could find it a normal object. That is the reason why we should establish a different strategy for our campaigns, depending on the target.</p>
